#### On the origins of Money: Carl Menger

* It is not the government edicts that create money but instead the marketplace. Individuals decide what the most marketable good is for use as a medium of exchange.

* Sadly the world's economies continue to gyrate between continuous booms and busts while money is in the hands of the world's central bankers. And while the free market is being blamed for the recent financial meltdowns, there can be no free market if money is controlled and debauched by the state. Menger provided the answer more than a century ago: a sound money, and in turn a sound economy can only be a product of the market.

* Why is that the economic man is ready to accept a certain kind of commodity, even if he does not need it, or if his need of it is already supplied, in exchange for all the good he has brought to the market, while it is none the less what he needs that he consults in the first instance, with respect to the goods he intends to acquire in the course of his transactions. What is the nature of those little disks or documents, is money an organic member in the world of commodities, or is it an economic anomaly? or are they distinct product of convention and authority?

* The enigmatic phenomenon of money is even at this day without an explanation that satisfies; nor is there yet agreement on the most fundamental questions of its nature and functions. Even at this day we have no satisfactory theory of money.

* The specific function of money as a universal current medium of exchange, was to refer to it to a general convention, or a legal dispensation. To assume that certain commodities, the precious metals in particular, had been exalted into the medium of exchange by general convention or law, in the interest of commonweal, solved the difficulty, and solved it apparently the more easily and naturally in as much as the shape of the coins seemed to be token of state regulation. Such in fact is the opinion of Pluto, Aristotle, and the Roman jurists, closely followed by the Mediaval writers. Even the more modern developments in the theory of money have not in substance got beyond this standpoint.

* Yet not historical monument gives us trustworthy tidings of any transactions either conferring distinct recognition on media of exchange already in use, or referring to their adoption by peoples of comparatively recent culture, much less testifying to an initiation of the earliest ages of economic civilization in the use of money.

* The peculiar adaptability of the precious metals for purposes of currency and coining was noticed by Aristotle, Xenophon, and Pliny, and to a far greater extent by John Law, Adam Smith and his disciples, who all seek a further explanation of the choice made of them as media of exchange, in their special qualifications. Nevertheless it is clear that the choice of precious metals by law and convention, even if made in consequence of their peculiar adaptability for monetary purposes, presupposes the pragmatic origin of money, and selection of those metals, and that presupposition is unhistorical. Nor do even the theorists above mentioned honestly face the problem that is to be solved, to wit, the explaining how it has come to pass that certain commodities should be promoted amongst the mass of all other commodities, and accepted as the generally acknowledged media of exchange. It is a question concerning not only the origin but also the nature of money and its position in relation to all other commodities.


* The different degrees of saleableness of commodities: the difference existing in this respect between articles of commerce is of the highest degree of significance for the theory of money, and of the market in general. And the failure to turn it adequately to account in explaining the phenomena of trade, constitutes not only as such a lamentable breach in our science, but also of the essential causes of the backward state of monetary theory. The theory of money necessarily presupposes a theory of the saleableness of goods. If we grasp this, we shall be able to understand how the almost unlimited saleableness of money is only a special case, - presenting only a difference of degree - of a generic phenomenon of economic life - namely, the difference in the saleableness of commodities in general.

* It is an error in economics, as prevalent as it is patent, that all commodities, at a definite point of time and in a given market, may be assumed to stand to each other in a definite relation of exchange, in other words, may be mutually exchanged in definite quantities at will. The most cursory observation of market phenomenon teaches us that it does not lie within our power, when we have bought an article for a certain price, to sell it again forthwith at the same price. This holds good of wholesale as well retail prices.

* Commerce and speculation would be the simplest things in the world, if the theory of the "objective equivalent in goods" were correct, if it were actually true, that in a given market and at a given moment commodities could be mutually converted at will in definite quantitative relations- could, in short, at a certain price be as easily disposed of as acquired.

* At any rate there is no such thing as general saleableness of wares in this sense. The truth is, that even in the best organized markets, while we may be able to purchase when and what we like at a definite price, we can only dispose of it again when and we like at a loss. If we call any goods or wares more or less saleable, according to the greater or less facility with which they can be disposed of at a market at any convenient time at current purchasing prices, or with less or more diminution of the same, we can see by what has been said, that an obvious difference exists in this connection between commodities.

* A commodity is more or less saleable according as we are able, with more or less prospect of success, to dispose of it at prices corresponding to the general economic situation, at economic prices. Account must be taken of the quantitative factor in the saleableness of commodities. Some commodities, in consequence of the development of markets and speculation, are able at any time of find a sale in practically any quantity at economic, approximately economic, prices. Other commodities can only find a sale at economic prices in smaller quantities, commensurate with the general growth of an effective demand, fetching a relatively reduced price in the case of a greater supply.


* The saleableness of a commodity depends upon the following circumstances:
    - upon the number of persons who are still in want of the commodity, and upon the extent and intensity of that want, which is un-supplied, or is constantly recurring
    - upon the purchasing power of the hose persons
    - upon the available quantity of the commodity in relation to the yet un-supplied want of it
    - upon the divisibility of the commodity, and any other ways in which it may be adjusted to the needs of the individual customers
    - upon the development of the market, and of speculation in particular, and finally
    - upon the number and nature of the limitations imposed politically and socially upon exchange and consumption with respect to the commodity in question

* The spatial limits of the saleableness of commodities are mainly conditioned:
 - by the degree to which the want of commodities is distributed in the space
 - by the degree to which the goods lend themselves to transport, and the cost of transport incurred in proportion to their value
 - by the extent to which the means of transport and of commerce generally are developed with respect to different classes of commodities
 - by the local extension of organized markets and their inter-communication by "arbitrage"
 - by the differences in the restrictions imposed upon commercial inter-communication with respect to different goods, to inter-local and, in particular, in international trade

 * The time limits to the saleableness of commodities are mainly conditioned:
  - by permanence in the need of them(their independence of fluctuation in the same)
  - their durability i.e. their suitableness for preservation
  - the cost of preserving and storing them
  - the rate of interest
  - the periodicity of a market for the same
  - the development of speculation and in particular of time-bargains in connection with the same
  - the restrictions imposed politically and socially on their being transferred from one period of time to another

* These properties explain why it is that certain commodities can be disposed of with ease and certainty in definite markets, i.e. within local and temporal limits, at any time and in practically any quantities, at prices corresponding to the general economic situation.
