### Economics in one lesson - Henry Hazlitt

* The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.

* The bad economists overlook the woods in their precise and minute examination of particular trees. Their methods and conclusions are often profoundly reactionary.

* To consider all the chief effects of a proposed course on everybody often requires a long, complicated, and dull chain of reasoning. Most of the audience finds this chain of reasoning difficult to follow and soon becomes bored and inattentive. The bad economists rationalize this intellectual debility and laziness by assuring the audience that it need not even attempt to follow the reasoning or judge it on its merits because it is only "classicism" or "laissez faire" or "capitalist apologetics" or whatever other term of abuse may happen to strike them as effective.

* The more war destroys, the more it impoverishes, the greater is the postwar need. But need is not demand. Effective economic demand requires not merely need but corresponding purchasing power.

* As most people are so firmly in the habit of thinking of their wealth and income in terms of money, they consider themselves better off as these monetary  totals rise, in spite of the fact that in terms of of things they may have less and buy less.

* The inability to produce automobiles, radios, and refrigerators during the war did bring about a cumulative postwar demand for those particular products. To most people this seemed like an increase in total demand, as it partly was in terms of dollars of lower purchasing power. But what mainly took place was a diversion of demand to these particular products from others.

* Here we shall have to say simply that all government expenditures must eventually be paid out of the proceeds of taxation; that inflation itself is merely a form, and a particularly vicious form, of taxation.

* A certain amount of public spending is necessary to perform. But the concern is with the public works considered as a means of "providing employment" or of adding wealth to the community that it would not otherwise have had.
A bridge built primarily "to provide employment" is a different kind of bridge. When providing employment becomes the end, need becomes a subordinate consideration. "Projects" have to be invented. Instead of thinking only of where bridges must be built, the government spenders begin to ask themselves where bridges can be built. 

* More wasteful the work, the more costly in manpower, the better it becomes for the purpose of providing more employment.

* All credit is debt. Proposals for an increased volume of credit, therefore, are merely another name for proposals for an increased burden of debt.

* There is a strange idea held by all monetary cranks, that credit is something a banker gives to a man. Credit, on the contrary, is something a man already has. He has it, perhaps, because he already has marketable assets of a greater cash value than the loan for which he is asking. Or he has it because his character and past record have earned it. He brings it into the bank with him. That is why the banker makes him the loan. The banker is not giving something for nothing. He feels assured of repayment. He is merely exchanging a more liquid form of asset or credit for a less liquid form. Sometimes he makes a mistake, and then it is not only the banker who suffers, but the whole community; for values which were supposed to be produced by the lender are not produced and resources are wasted.

* The proposal is frequently made that the government ought to assume that risks that are "too great for private industry". This means that bureaucrats should be permitted to take risks with the taxpayers' money that no one is willing to take with his own.

* The advocates of government-guaranteed mortgages also forget that what is being lent is ultimately real capital, which is limited in supply, and that they are helping identified B at the expense of some unidentified A. They encourage people to "buy" houses that they cannot really afford. They tend eventually to bring about an oversupply of houses as compared with other things. They temporarily overstimulate building, raise the cost of building for everybody and may mislead the building industry into an eventually costly overexpansion. In brief, in the long run they do not increase overall national production but encourage malinvestment.


* Even the much vaunted "government credit" rests on the assumption that its loans will ultimately be repaid out of the proceeds of taxes. When the government makes loans or subsidies to business, what it does is to tax successful private business in order to support unsuccessful private industry. Under certain circumstances there may be a plausible argument for this, this merits of which we need not examine here. But in the long run it does not sound like a paying proposition from the standpoint of the country as a whole. And experience has shown that it isn't.
