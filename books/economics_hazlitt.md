### Economics in one lesson - Henry Hazlitt

* The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.

* The bad economists overlook the woods in their precise and minute examination of particular trees. Their methods and conclusions are often profoundly reactionary.

* To consider all the chief effects of a proposed course on everybody often requires a long, complicated, and dull chain of reasoning. Most of the audience finds this chain of reasoning difficult to follow and soon becomes bored and inattentive. The bad economists rationalize this intellectual debility and laziness by assuring the audience that it need not even attempt to follow the reasoning or judge it on its merits because it is only "classicism" or "laissez faire" or "capitalist apologetics" or whatever other term of abuse may happen to strike them as effective.

* The more war destroys, the more it impoverishes, the greater is the postwar need. But need is not demand. Effective economic demand requires not merely need but corresponding purchasing power.

* As most people are so firmly in the habit of thinking of their wealth and income in terms of money, they consider themselves better off as these monetary  totals rise, in spite of the fact that in terms of of things they may have less and buy less.

* The inability to produce automobiles, radios, and refrigerators during the war did bring about a cumulative postwar demand for those particular products. To most people this seemed like an increase in total demand, as it partly was in terms of dollars of lower purchasing power. But what mainly took place was a diversion of demand to these particular products from others.

* Here we shall have to say simply that all government expenditures must eventually be paid out of the proceeds of taxation; that inflation itself is merely a form, and a particularly vicious form, of taxation.

* A certain amount of public spending is necessary to perform. But the concern is with the public works considered as a means of "providing employment" or of adding wealth to the community that it would not otherwise have had.
A bridge built primarily "to provide employment" is a different kind of bridge. When providing employment becomes the end, need becomes a subordinate consideration. "Projects" have to be invented. Instead of thinking only of where bridges must be built, the government spenders begin to ask themselves where bridges can be built. 

* More wasteful the work, the more costly in manpower, the better it becomes for the purpose of providing more employment.
